    <h2>What is neural network?</h2>
    <p>
        Neural network is computer graph. In a graph, every node represent a Tensor / Value / Matrix / Scalar.
        An edge is function argument. A node with an incoming edge is a function of this edge's tail node. A function can be
        nullary, unary, binary, ..., n-ary which means it takes 0 to N parameters. Comparaed to static graph, dynamic
        graph is more flexible but more slower.

    <h2>Build the first neural network</h2>
    <p>
        The simplies model may look this. Each word has 5 dimensions corresponing to total number of labels. However, when word "not" and "nothing", which all represents negative attitudes, combined together, whole meaning of sentence may change.
        So, we need some complicated function to extract combination features.
